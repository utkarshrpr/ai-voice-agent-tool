### Build an AI Voice Agent Tool

**Objective:**

Your task is to build a functional web application that allows a **non-technical administrator** to configure, test, and review calls made by an adaptive AI voice agent. The project centers on creating a simple and intuitive UI for three core administrative functions: **configuring** the agent\'s logic, **triggering** test calls, and **analyzing** the structured results. The test calls need to be web calls (using RetellAI APIs) and not phone calls.

**Recommendations:**
Maintain code quality and modularity. 

### Part 1: Core Requirements & Technology Stack {#part-1-core-requirements-technology-stack}

You are to build a web application using **React**, **Typescript, FastAPI**, and **Supabase**. You will use **Retell AI** for the voice system. The application you build must meet the following requirements for its administrative user:
1. The user should be able to create only single prompt agents in RetellAI using API calls from the backend and define the system prompt and Retell AI\'s advanced settings, such as **backchanneling**, **filler words**, and **interruption sensitivity** for the agent via the UI.
2. The user can update the system prompt and Retell AI\'s advanced settings, such as **backchanneling**, **filler words**, and **interruption sensitivity** for the agent via the UI.
3.  **Call Triggering & Results UI:** From the dashboard, the administrator must be able to:
    - Select the configured voice agent from a dropdown menu.
    - Enter the driver\'s name, phone number, and the relevant load number into fields to provide context for the call.
    - Click a \"Start Test Call\" button to trigger a web call from the selected voice agent.
    - After the call is complete, view the results in a structured, easy-to-read format. This summary should present the key information collected during the call as clear key-value pairs, alongside the full call transcript.

4.  **Backend Logic:** Your FastAPI backend will serve as the webhook for Retell AI, containing the logic to interpret the prompts from the database and guide the agent\'s conversation in real-time. Your backend must also include a post-processing step to structure the raw transcript into the clean summary displayed in the UI.

### Part 2: Project Task - Implement and Test Logistics Agents

The web application you build will be used to implement and test the two logistics agent scenarios detailed below. Your submission should demonstrate that your platform can successfully configure and run these scenarios.

#### **Task A: Implement Optimal Voice Configuration**

#### **Scenario 1: Logistics - End-to-End Driver Check-in (\"Dispatch\")**

- **Context:** The agent is calling a driver about a specific load (e.g., Mike, Load \#7891-B from Barstow to Phoenix). The system knows the load\'s details but does not know the driver\'s current status (they could be mid-transit or have just arrived).

- **Goal:** Configure the agent to handle the entire check-in conversation as a single, fluid thread. The agent must first determine the driver\'s status by asking an open-ended question like, \"Hi Mike, this is Dispatch with a check call on load 7891-B. Can you give me an update on your status?\" Based on the driver\'s response, the agent must dynamically pivot its line of questioning.

- **Structured Data to Collect (Success Case):** Your system\'s post-processing must extract and display the following structured data for the administrator:

  - call_outcome: \"In-Transit Update\" OR \"Arrival Confirmation\"

  - driver_status: \"Driving\" OR \"Delayed\" OR \"Arrived\" OR \"Unloading\"

  - current_location: (e.g., \"I-10 near Indio, CA\")

  - eta: (e.g., \"Tomorrow, 8:00 AM\")

  - delay_reason: (e.g., \"Heavy Traffic\", \"Weather\", \"None\")

  - unloading_status: (e.g., \"In Door 42\", \"Waiting for Lumper\", \"Detention\", \"N/A\")

  - pod_reminder_acknowledged: true OR false

#### **Scenario 2: Logistics - Dynamic Emergency Protocol (\"Dispatch\")**

- **Context:** The agent is in the middle of a routine check call when the driver interrupts with an emergency (e.g., \"I just had a blowout, I\'m pulling over\").

- **Goal:** This is the most critical test. Configure your system so the agent can **immediately abandon its standard conversation thread** in response to an emergency trigger phrase. It must gather critical information and then escalate by stating it is connecting the driver to a human dispatcher.

- **Structured Data to Collect (Success Case):** In an emergency, the structured summary must contain:

  - call_outcome: \"Emergency Escalation\"

  - emergency_type: \"Accident\" OR \"Breakdown\" OR \"Medical\" OR \"Other\"

  - safety_status: (e.g., \"Driver confirmed everyone is safe\")

  - injury_status: (e.g., \"No injuries reported\")

  - emergency_location: (e.g., \"I-15 North, Mile Marker 123\")

  - load_secure: true OR false

  - escalation_status: \"Connected to Human Dispatcher\"

#### **Task B: Implement Dynamic Response Handling**

Your implementation must also gracefully handle the following special cases, which will be used to test your system\'s robustness:

- **The Uncooperative Driver:** The agent should be able to probe for more information when given one-word answers and know when to end the call if the driver remains unresponsive.

- **The Noisy Environment:** The agent should be able to handle garbled speech-to-text results by asking the driver to repeat themselves a limited number of times before escalating.

- **The Conflicting Driver:** The agent should be able to handle discrepancies between the driver\'s stated location and the system\'s GPS data in a non-confrontational way.
